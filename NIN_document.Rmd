I remember watching the music video *Head Like a Hole* on MTV and being blown away. Instantly, Nine Inch Nails (NIN) was my favorite band and Trent Reznor became my teenage crush `r emo::ji("heart_eyes")`. Finally, in my twenties I went to see NIN live. The opening act was  Queens of the Stone Age. It rocked! I dressed in the black vinyl and leather pieces I had in my closet; along with my coveted black knee high Doc Martens. My inner teenager squeed with delight. I don't listen to NIN as much as I used too, mainly because my musical tastes have changed and expanded since then. I love listening to jazz and swing while cooking dinner, but my teenage self would have sqwinched her face in disgust `r emo::ji("stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes")`. I just have to remember that we don't owe anything to our past selves.  
  
I had Pretty Hate Machine on tape. I wore that poor tape out on my yellow Sony Sports Walkman with the Super Bass button. The album is so seared in my mind; if one of the songs from Pretty Hate Machine comes up in a play list my mind is waiting for the next track. When it doesn't, I'm a little dissapointed. Pretty Hate Machine was my jam and made me feel pumped. Music has a way of giving voice to our feelings and has an influence on them. There is a music metric which is reflective of how a song makes us feel, it is called valence. From my science background valence is a term I remember from chemistry and physics. But, in the musical world of Spotify it has nothing to do with orbitals or electrons. This is how Spotify defines valence,  
    
  *"A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."*   
  
  The definition and some explanation into its creation can be found in the [Spotify documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-several-audio-features/). Considering how pumped that album made me feel and the shifts in the subsequent albums, did the valence of Nine Inch Nails albums change over time? Let's find out.

In order to answer my question I used the R package [spotifyr](https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr), to retrieve the data from Spotify. Check the link if you want to know more about the spotifyr package and how set up a dev account with Spotify. Also, if you want to see all the R code for this document and analysis visit my [Github repo](). I limited the analysis to the nine standard studio albums and Broken. The [ten albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Inch_Nails_discography#Studio_albums) are `r studio_albums[1:9]`, and `r studio_albums[10]`. With data in hand, I needed to do a little cleaning. I found some instances of duplication in the data-set. The duplication seemed to stem from significant digit rounding which created duplicate entries for some of the calculated metrics. I removed the duplicates by using album_name and track_name. I didn't use track number as this would filter out tracks from a double album.  

For this type of data a box plot is appropriate. Box plots allow us to visualize the relative difference in distribution of valence between the albums. The bar in the middle of the box represents the [median](https://www.mathsisfun.com/median.html) valence of the album, while the upper and lower bounds of the box correspond to the 25th and 75th percentiles. This means 50% of the data fall within the box and data that are beyond the whiskers are outliers. I've also added the individual track valence values for the albums, so each point on the plot represents the valence of a track from an album. 
  
I used the color pallet from the Pretty Hate Machine [cover art](https://www.nin.wiki/images/4/40/PHMvinyl.jpg) and I extracted the major hex colors using [color explorer](http://www.colorexplorer.com/imageimport.aspx). In keeping with the theme I made sure to have NIN fonts as well. I found some [NIN fonts](https://www.nindestruct.com/fonts.html) and installed the fonts using the [extrafont package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/extrafont/README.html). In order to create the blur I want to give a shout-out to the cool R package [ggecho](https://coolbutuseless.github.io/2019/03/22/ggecho-an-experimental-ggplot-stat-for-blurring-elements/) for helping to give the plots a little late 80's - early 90's flare. 
  
So, enough about colors and fonts. Let's check out the plot. There do appear to be differences in valence between albums. Most notably the first two, Pretty Hate Machine and Broken. How do we know if those differences are real?

To determine if the valence was different between albums, first I needed to run a few tests on the data. First I tested for normality. I did this using the Shapiro-Wilk Normality test. For a Shapiro-Wilk test, if a p-value > 0.05 it implies that the distribution of the valence data of each album are not significantly different from a normal distribution. In other words, I can assume the normality. Table One shows that a few of the albums do have a non-normal distribution. The second is to test for homogeneity of the variances. Since the data already broke the normality assumption I used the Levene test instead of the Bartlett's. The variances are similar according to the Levene test as shown in Table Two.

<font style="font-family: helvetica; font-size:12pt">
Now, I have the information I need to see if the valences of the albums are different from each other? Based on the output from the first two tables I went with a non-parametric test. As an aside, you could transform the data to make them normal and use a parametric test. So, I decided to use the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, which tests if the medians of the valence among the albums are equal. The output is in Table Three. The p-value from the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates that we should have a further look, that the valence of some of the albums might be different from each other. In the box-plot there are a couple of albums which stand out as being different from each other: Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, Hesitation Marks, and Bad Witch. Since these four albums all have normal distributions, I went ahead and used the simple t.test. I could have used the Wilcox but I wanted to keep it simple.

So, there are differences in valence between some of the NIN albums across time. The stand out really is between the first album, Pretty Hate Machine, and the second Broken. I wouldn't hazard a guess as to why the valence changed so much, I'm sure there are amazing people out there who have their own hypotheses! There was something about the shape of the medians across time that reminded me of an article I read a while ago. It might be a stretch but this plot reminded me of the [happiness/ well being by age studies](https://www.pnas.org/content/107/22/9985). The gist is that reported well being changes as we age and that there is a general "U" shape pattern to the data. The dip in the "U" ,the most negative well being scores, is about 50 years of age.

<font style="font-family: helvetica; font-size:12pt">
I didn't have access to the original data, so I used the [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) to extract the plot data points from the research paper; then download the .csv file and read it into R. In the original study the respondents are placed into four year time bins. To match the happiness study data I added Trent Reznor's age at each album release and subtracted two years to estimate the age of at which he was working on the album. Two years seemed like a reasonable estimate. Then I binned the valence data by the same time bins as the happiness study and calculated the mean. It is an interesting, if suggestive, plot. Maybe they do track each other just a wee bit?
